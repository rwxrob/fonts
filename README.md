# My Font Collection

Just a bunch of random fonts, some I use more than others. Not
everything is open source / creative commons but I just can't remember
where I got them all. I know for a fact that `Consola` is a proprietary
Microsoft font (but I've purchased over a 100 systems that have it).
Please do your own legal research before using in anything significant.
I'm leaving the LICENSE off of this repo.

I actually paid someone \$25 for Spy Agency only to have someone else
tell me that it is a free font. I even wrote a nice email to the guy.
Either I got royally suckered or he was the original creator. I still
have no idea.

Might also want to checkout the following scripts as well:
